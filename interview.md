## Tell us about Front End tech you use?  We have this old monster jQuery thing...

jQuery and AJAX were fun.  It made things a lot easier.  Thankfully, JavaScript has really caught up (from ES6 onward).  It's still something I could refamiliarize with, and get a lot done.  I'd try to talk you out of launching any brand new work with jQuery.

The big revelation with learning React or Vue is the idea of Reactive Programming.  I always thought of it as "the change to this variable fires off an event".

I prefer Vue to React, but am happy with both.  Although I know Vuex (for state management), I prefer Pinia for my personal projects. Same on the React side... I can work with Redux, but much prefer an approach such as [Zustand](https://zustand.surge.sh/)

Along with modern JS and frameworks/libs such as Svelte, React, and Vue, there's a whole ecosystem to support it. I like Vite or Parcel.  They make developing and building straightforward.

I am relieved that Flexbox and Grid support is universally supported in modern browsers. I dont know every nuance of CSS, but I appreciate being able to get a lot done with Tailwind CSS.

It is easier to keep up with Back End/Serverless Technologies.

## How about Back End?  We have an old LAMP project that needs an update...

Heh, PHP.  I used to know that very well, going back to the early 2000's.  I even wrote an article for O'Reilly about using Here Documents in PHP.  I've worked with Apache & nginx, and lots of MySQL.

That stack is something I know, but it has been a while.  

There are some things from that era that I'd happily use in new projects (MySQL, memcache, redis).  I like Node + Express + Mongoose + MongoDB.

I like calling 3rd party APIs, such as Google Maps and Places, GeoJSON, Yelp, etc.

I am learning Python - that will be a starting point towards knowing more of the AI/ML side.

## So, you've been working with AWS lately?  Do you want to be DevOps person?

Nope!  There is so much more to the Cloud than the operations side.

To be clear, I like the simplicity of dropping a folder on Netlify, and having it take care of so much for me.

However, I like AWS from a project standpoint - gluing together a bunch of services.  I am not looking to be a networking/operations guru.  I was a sysadmin, long ago, for Industrial Light & Magic (Lucasfilm), so I do have a little insight.

My recent project used Lambda functions (Node.js) to concatenate mp3/mp4 media sources (of tech interviews), and produce clip highlights (driven from a JSON file of inputs and outputs). It used API Gateway, S3, EFS, SNS, and DynamoDB.  I used layers to run ffmpeg.  Learned a lot, and am nowstudying for an AWS Certificate.

## Would you go to the whiteboard and invert this binary tree?

Ha ha!  Yeah, I do know the answer to that one.  What do you people do all day?  Perhaps ask me a question that is relevant to solving a current issue that you have?

I once had an interview with a major retailer about front end work on their catalog site.  They asked me to implement "Conways Game of Life" (Cellular Automata).  I did a fine job, but, seriously, keep it relevant.

My dream interview is to meet with folks from a wide variety of discplines (Design, FE/BE, QA, Project Management, etc).  I'd want to know enough to be able to talk intelligently about what it is that they do, and how I can collaborate with them.  I am a big fan of teams that pull together to accomplish something big, where everyone has a mutual respect for all the roles that go into it.
