## Do you work well with others?

Yep! I think it's important to have a couple of core ideas in mind when it comes to every team member:

* insight - have at least some surface knowledge about all parts that come together - know your strong points, your core areas, and theirs.
* respect - everyone has their own specialty, and they bring something to the table.  Admire what every stakeholder contributes.


Offer to listen.  Be a mentor (but never force that).  The important thing is making customers (external and internal) happy.  Your customers could care less about internal politics or silly fiefdoms.  They want to be happy with their experience with your product.  Focus on what's important, and don't be petty with anyone.

## Tell us about Front End tech you use?  We have this old monster jQuery thing...

jQuery and AJAX were fun.  It made things a lot easier.  Thankfully, JavaScript has really caught up (from ES6 onward).  It's still something I could refamiliarize with, and get a lot done.  I'd try to talk you out of launching any brand new work with jQuery.

The big revelation with learning React or Vue is the idea of Reactive Programming.  I always thought of it as "the change to this variable fires off an event".

I prefer Vue to React, but am happy with both.  Although I know Vuex (for state management), I prefer Pinia for my personal projects. Same on the React side... I can work with Redux, but much prefer an approach such as [Zustand](https://zustand.surge.sh/)

Along with modern JS and frameworks/libs such as Svelte, React, and Vue, there's a whole ecosystem to support it. I like Vite or Parcel.  They make developing and building straightforward.

I am relieved that Flexbox and Grid support is universally supported in modern browsers. I dont know every nuance of CSS, but I appreciate being able to get a lot done with Tailwind CSS.

It is easier to keep up with Back End/Serverless Technologies.  The Front End is always going to be the Wild West of Programming.

## How about Back End?  We have an old LAMP project that needs an update...

Heh, PHP.  I used to know that very well, going back to the early 2000's.  I even wrote an article for O'Reilly about using Here Documents in PHP.  I've worked with Apache & nginx, and lots of MySQL.

That stack is something I know, but it has been a while.  

There are some things from that era that I'd happily use in new projects (MySQL, memcache, redis).  I like Node + Express + Mongoose + MongoDB.

I like calling 3rd party APIs, such as Google Maps and Places, GeoJSON, Yelp, etc.

I am learning Python - that will be a starting point towards knowing more of the AI/ML side.

## So, you've been working with AWS lately?  Do you want to be DevOps person?

Nope!  There is so much more to the Cloud than the operations side.

To be clear, I like the simplicity of dropping a folder on Netlify, and having it take care of so much for me.

However, I like AWS from a project standpoint - gluing together a bunch of services.  I am not looking to be a networking/operations guru.  I was a sysadmin, long ago, for Industrial Light & Magic (Lucasfilm), so I do have a little insight.

My recent project used Lambda functions (Node.js) to concatenate mp3/mp4 media sources (of tech interviews), and produce clip highlights (driven from a JSON file of inputs and outputs). It used API Gateway, S3, EFS, SNS, and DynamoDB.  I used layers to run ffmpeg.  Learned a lot, and am nowstudying for an AWS Certificate.

## Would you go to the whiteboard and invert this binary tree?

Ha ha!  Yeah, I do know the answer to that one.  Remind me, *What* do you people do all day?  Perhaps ask me a question that is relevant to solving a current issue that you have?

I once had an interview with a major retailer about front end work on their catalog site.  They asked me to implement "Conways Game of Life" (Cellular Automata).  I did a fine job, but, seriously, keep it relevant.

My dream interview is to meet with folks from a wide variety of discplines (Design, FE/BE, QA, Project Management, etc).  I'd want to know enough to be able to talk intelligently about what it is that they do, and how I can collaborate with them.  I am a big fan of teams that pull together to accomplish something big, where everyone has a mutual respect for all the roles that go into it.

## Where do you see yourself five years from now?

Starting a Digital Studio, to bring a wide range of Creative and Tech capabilities under one roof (real or virtual).  Personally, I'd love to convert a big Old Barn into a studio.

I have interests that span a lot of things: 3D, Photo, Video, Sound Design, Mapping, Search, etc.  I've always been a generalist, and it's always my goal to want to be able to talk with the folks in those areas, and to have at least some insight in what they do.  I want to be someone that can glue together teams that can do amazing projects.
