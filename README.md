## `Hello from Daniel Smith`

_I am writing this... it's not near done.. avert your eyes_


## Introduction

I am web/app developer that enjoys mixing the creative and technical worlds.  I can be happy on the front end, the server (or serverless) side, or both. A few special interests are Social media, Mapping, and Search that melds Location, Time, and Tags.

* üñ•Ô∏è `Front End` - Vue (Pinia/Vite/Parcel/etc), React (Zustand), Tailwind CSS
* üîå`Back End` - Mostly Node, Express, MongoDB, MySQL.  Used to LAMP, now I JAMStack.  Learning Python
* ‚ö° `More Buzzwords` - Netlify, AWS (Lambda, S3, API Gateway, SNS, DynamoDB)
* üè† `Location` - I am currently in Indianapolis.  I am a native Californian, mostly SF Bay Area.  I also loved living in NYC (Upper West) for a couple of years.
* üìΩÔ∏è `Besides Tech` - I'm always picking up my Guitar. I love Film and Travel - Am way overdue for a Road Trip.
* üìú `Resume` - is at [resume.daniel.org](http://resume.daniel.org)

## Projects / Writing

An overall interest of mine would be "how do we search through media, by time, place, or tags?"  There's all sorts of things that tie into that.. how do you store it, what is the UI, and so on.  Another thing that ties in, but can very much stand on its own, is this idea of attaching dynamic menus to links and images.

So, having mentioned that, I can point at some work where I am poking around at those themes:

* [alap - Menus For Links](https://dev.to/danielsmith/alap-menus-for-links-5e95)
* [Alap demo site](https://alap.info/)
* [Alap Editor: Vue Version Demo](https://editor-vue.alap.info/)
* [Alap Github Repo](https://github.com/DanielSmith/alap) - [Alap editor: Vue Version Repo](https://github.com/DanielSmith/alap-editor-vue)
* [Mapping Cites w/GeoJSON](https://medium.com/js-dojo/how-to-map-cities-with-vue-geojson-and-google-box-set-7d9afd486070)
* [An old (2017) look at ThereThenThat - Mapping Web Addresses to Location, Time, and Tags](https://javajoint.medium.com/therethenthat-mapping-web-addresses-to-location-time-and-tags-december-20-2017-copyright-2003-6df810a0e49a)

Gave myself [a few softball questions](interview.md) about Tech and a few other things.
